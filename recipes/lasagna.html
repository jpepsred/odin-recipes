    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I learned this recipe from an Italian friend while in Highschool.
        He claims it's a recipe his nona invented by trial and error when
        trying to please the prince whose kitchen she worked in. He did 
        have a habit of exagerating though!
    </p>
    <p>
        The recipe uses common pamtry ingredients like tinned tomatoes and 
        dried lasagna sheets, but can be improved greatly with a jar of tomatoes
        from your local Italian shop, and basil fresh from your windowsill.
