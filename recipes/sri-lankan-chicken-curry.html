    <h1>Sri Lankan Chicken Curry</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I learned this recipe while travelling in South India. 
        I stayed with a farmer from Sri Lanka, and he cooked a Curry 
        for me with the most tender chicken I've ever tasted. I've tried
        my best to recreate the recipe over the years, and this is what
        I've come up with for an authentic Sri Lankan curry.

        Thighs work best, but breasts will work too. The great thing about 
        curries is how versatile they are--they can be served with other curries, 
        bread, rice, lentils, you name it! I suggest serving this curry with
        steamed rice.
